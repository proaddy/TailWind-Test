# TailWind-Test
This is a trial for testing how tailwind CSS works in HTML 

We can either have the tailwind installed directly on our local device or else we can use play cdn of tailwind CSS.
*Caution!!!* Play CDN should not be used in a development environment

Click here to redirect to [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) website.
on the installation page, we can either go to the play CDN section and copy the script tag ( make sure to be connected to the internet )
or we can just follow the postcss process to install the tailwindCSS locally. 

NOTE: any installation is done by assuming that you have already installed Node.js on your system if not then please first install Node.js

###### HAPPY CODING
