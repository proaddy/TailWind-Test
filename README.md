# TailWind-Test
This is a trial for testing how tailwind CSS works in HTML 

We can either install the tailwind directly on our local device or use play cdn of tailwind CSS.
*Caution!!!* Play CDN should not be used in a development environment

Click here to redirect to [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) website.
on the installation page, we can either go to the play CDN section and copy the script tag ( make sure to be connected to the internet )
or we can follow the postcss process to install the tailwindCSS locally. 

### The process is as follows
  1. initialize node (npm init -y)
  2. install dependencies including vite (npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite)
  3. initialize tailwindcss (npx tailwindcss init -p) here -p will generate a postcss config file
  4. Copy the tailwindcss directives to your CSS file inside the project, step 4 of the using postcss section from the website. Then include the CSS file inside HTML.

After the setup process is complete we can start with building the website.

NOTE: any installation is done by assuming that you have already installed Node.js on your system if not then please first install Node.js

###### HAPPY CODING
